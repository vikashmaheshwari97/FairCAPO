    - Tested on Hinted MMLU, Targeted Sycophancy, and other environments

-   **Beyond the Answer: Decoding the Behavior of LLMs as Scientific Reasoners (ICLR 2026 Workshop)**

    ---

    Pandey, Ye & Li (Post-AGI Science and Society Workshop, ICLR 2026) use a GEPA-based approach to systematically optimize prompts for scientific reasoning tasks, finding that reasoning gains correspond to **model-specific heuristics that fail to generalize** across systems — framing prompt optimization as a tool for model interpretability.

-   **$0 Reproducible GEPA Examples: How a 1.2B Model Got +25 Points**

    ---

    Three end-to-end GEPA runs (RAG QA with citations, multi-step math reasoning, typed invoice extraction) entirely on OpenRouter's free tier — zero spend, single-seed reproducibility. Demonstrates a surprising saturation lesson: larger task LMs often leave GEPA with nothing to optimize because every minibatch is already all-correct. Using a 1.2B task LM (Liquid LFM 2.5) lifted math reasoning from **45% → 70%** through 5 accepted mutations.

    **Key insights:**

    - **Baseline saturation:** GLM 4.5 Air (32B) and Ministral 8B both accept zero mutations on grade-school math — no failure signal means no reflection
    - **Task-LM matching matters:** Pick a model that fails on enough examples to generate signal, not the largest available
    - **Format problems vs knowledge problems:** On RAG QA, GEPA's +18.85pt gain came from teaching consistent citation emission, not new knowledge

-   **Exploring GEPA: Context Management at the Static vs Runtime Layer (Quarq Labs)**

    ---

    Quarq Labs frames GEPA and Recursive Language Models (RLMs) as complementary thrusts on the same problem — LLMs are passive consumers of context. GEPA optimizes the *static* layer (instructions, retrieval queries, agent scaffolding) ahead of time; RLMs handle the *dynamic* layer at runtime. Together they suggest a shift from "stuff everything into the context window" to systems that actively curate and manage context.

    **Highlights:**

    - Argues that ASI (Actionable Side Information) plays the role of a gradient, but expressed in text rather than numbers
    - GEPA's Pareto front prevents premature convergence on a single solution
    - Cites GEPA's efficiency: +6-19pp over GRPO with 35x fewer rollouts; +10pp over MIPROv2 (+12pp on AIME-2025)
    - Discusses MCP, DSPy full-program, and generic RAG adapters as evidence that GEPA generalizes beyond simple system prompts
