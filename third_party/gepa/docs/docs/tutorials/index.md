# Tutorials

Welcome to the GEPA tutorials! These hands-on notebooks will help you learn GEPA through practical examples.

## Available Tutorials

### DSPy Full Program Evolution

Learn how to use GEPA to evolve entire DSPy programs, including custom signatures, modules, and control flow logic.

- **[DSPy Full Program Evolution](dspy_full_program_evolution.ipynb)** - Evolve a complete DSPy program from a basic `ChainOfThought` to a sophisticated multi-step reasoning system. This tutorial demonstrates how GEPA can improve a program from 67% to 93% accuracy on the MATH benchmark.

### ARC AGI Example

- **[ARC AGI Example](arc_agi.ipynb)** - Apply GEPA to the ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) challenge, demonstrating how to optimize programs for complex reasoning tasks.

### 3D Unicorn Optimization (Seedless)

Use GEPA's `seed_candidate=None` mode to evolve a complete Python program (build123d + pyrender) that generates a 3D unicorn — starting from no code at all. This tutorial demonstrates how to optimize when you know *what good looks like* (evaluation aspects) but don't know *how to get started* (no seed). GEPA bootstraps the first candidate from a natural-language objective, then iteratively refines it using VLM feedback on rendered multi-view images.

- **[3D Unicorn Optimization](3d_unicorn_optimization.ipynb)** - From no code to a 600+ line 3D modeling program through seedless optimization with visual feedback.

### ConfidenceAdapter AG News Tutorial

A hands-on notebook for classification-only GEPA optimization using AG News. You can run the full tutorial end-to-end with `DefaultAdapter` versus `ConfidenceAdapter`, inspect GEPA prompt evolution, and reproduce confidence-based metrics and charts.

- **[ConfidenceAdapter Classification Tutorial](confidence_adapter_classification.ipynb)** - Compare default and confidence-aware classification optimization, from dataset split to AG News per-class and calibration plots.

### LangChain Adapter

- **[LangChain GEPA Adapter Tutorial](langchain_adapter_pair_sum_product_walkthrough.ipynb)** - Walkthrough for how to use langchain v1+ `ChatModel` or agent on a synthetic data task
