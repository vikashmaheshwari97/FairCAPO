## About

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. 

We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness.

Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware.

## Installation

To run experiments or contribute to this project, it is recommended to follow these steps:

### Set-up poetry and install dependencies

1.) Clone or fork this repository

2.) Install pipx:
```
pip install --user pipx
```

3.) Install Poetry:
```
pipx install poetry
```

*3a.) Optionally (if you want the env-folder to be created in your project)*:
```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

4.) Install this project:
```
poetry install
```

*4a.) If the specified Python version (3.12 for this project) is not found:*

If the required Python version is not installed on your device, install Python from the official [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads) website.

Then run
```
poetry env use <path-to-your-python-version>
```
and install the project:
```
poetry install
```

## Run Experiments

All experiments can be executed via the `scripts/experiment.py` script (`scripts/experiment_wizard.py` for PromptWizard).

Experiments can be parametrized directly per command line arguments.

Example experiment (CAPO with Qwen2.5-32B on Subj, 10 steps / 1M input token budget with default parametrization):
```
poetry run python scripts/experiment.py --experiment-name test --random-seed 42 \
    --budget-per-run 1000000 --output-dir results/ --dataset subj \
    --model vllm-Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4\
    --model-revision c83e67dfb2664f5039fd4cd99e206799e27dd800 \
    --max-model-len 2048 --optimizer CAPO --n-steps 10 --population-size 10 \
    --max-n-blocks-eval 10 --block-size 30 --length-penalty 0.05 \
    --crossovers-per-iter 4 --upper-shots 5 --alpha 0.2
```
This command will automatically download the specified model from HuggingFace and use vLLM to host it. We recommend at least 80GB of GPU RAM to ensure smooth execution of the experiments. If you've already downloaded the model, you can specify its location by adding the ``--model-storage-path`` command line argument to your call.
